# Facial Expression Recognition

This is the implementation for my undergraduate thesis "Feature-Level Joint Learning for Facial Expression Recognition" and the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8528894) "Facial Expression Recognition with Identity and
Emotion Joint Learning".

**Notice**: This repository is now an placeholder and I am refactoring the code for better usage.


<!--The data and trained weights have not been released now so the code contains just a two-way network architecture under the environment of Keras2 and tensorflow backend.-->
