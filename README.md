# facial-expression-recognition

This is the implementation for my undergraduate thesis *Feature-Level Joint Learning for Facial Expression Recognition* and the paper []().

**Notice**: This repository is now an placeholder and I am refactoring the code for better usage.


<!--The data and trained weights have not been released now so the code contains just a two-way network architecture under the environment of Keras2 and tensorflow backend.-->
